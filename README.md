## Installation
To set up the Gupta Store project locally, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   cd gupta-store
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
   Simply open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the project.

There are no additional installation steps since this project uses CDN links for styles and scripts.

## Usage

## Dependencies
The project utilizes the following libraries included via CDN:
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Font Awesome**: For icon usage.

No additional npm dependencies are present according to the package.json since this project is purely front-end based.
